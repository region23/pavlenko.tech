# Getting Started with Static Blog Development

Welcome to my tech blog! This article will guide you through the process of creating a modern static blog using JavaScript and Markdown.

## The Power of Markdown

Markdown makes content creation simple and efficient:

- **Bold text** for emphasis
- *Italic text* for subtle highlights
- ~~Strikethrough~~ for outdated information

### Code Blocks with Syntax Highlighting

```javascript
// JavaScript example
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

// Modern ES6 features
const greeting = (name) => `Hello, ${name}!`;
console.log(greeting('world'));
```

### Blockquotes for Highlighting Important Information

> Static blogs offer exceptional performance, security, and simplicity.
> They're perfect for developers who want complete control over their content.

## Setting Up Your Project Structure

A well-organized project structure makes development and maintenance easier:

1. Create your base directory: `mkdir static-blog`
2. Set up essential folders:
   - `content/` - For your Markdown files
   - `js/` - For JavaScript modules
   - `css/` - For styling
   - `images/` - For media files

### Key Files to Create

- `index.html` - Main entry point
- `js/app.js` - Core application logic
- `js/router.js` - Client-side routing
- `css/style.css` - Styling

## Adding Images and Links

Links [work like this](https://example.com), and images can be easily embedded:

## JavaScript for Dynamic Content

The beauty of a static blog is using JavaScript to dynamically render content:

```javascript
async function fetchMarkdownContent(path) {
  const response = await fetch(path);
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error('Failed to load content');
  }
  return response.text();
}

async function renderMarkdown(content) {
  // Using a library like marked.js
  return marked(content);
}
```

## Conclusion

This simple example demonstrates how you can create a modern static blog with JavaScript and Markdown. The approach gives you complete control over your content while maintaining excellent performance and security.
