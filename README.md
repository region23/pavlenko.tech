## Configuration

The blog is fully customizable through the `config.json` file. You can modify the following settings:

### Site Configuration

```json
"site": {
  "title": "Your Blog Title",
  "description": "Your blog description here",
  "language": "en",
  "copyright": "Â© 2025 Your Name",
  "hostname": "your-domain.com"
}
```

### Navigation

```json
"navigation": {
  "items": [
    {
      "label": "Blog",
      "url": "/"
    },
    {
      "label": "Tags",
      "url": "/tags"
    },
    {
      "label": "About",
      "url": "/about"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Social Links

```json
"social": {
  "links": [
    {
      "platform": "GitHub",
      "url": "https://github.com/yourusername"
    },
    {
      "platform": "Twitter",
      "url": "https://twitter.com/yourusername"
    },
    {
      "platform": "LinkedIn",
      "url": "https://linkedin.com/in/yourusername"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Appearance

```json
"appearance": {
  "colors": {
    "primary": "#3f51b5",
    "secondary": "#ff4081",
    "accent": "#00bcd4",
    "background": "#ffffff",
    "surface": "#f5f5f5",
    "text": "#212121",
    "border": "#e0e0e0"
  },
  "darkMode": {
    "background": "#121212",
    "surface": "#1e1e1e",
    "text": "#ffffff",
    "border": "#333333"
  },
  "fonts": {
    "main": "Inter",
    "code": "JetBrains Mono"
  }
}
```

### Content Settings

```json
"content": {
  "postsPerPage": 10,
  "showReadingTime": true,
  "defaultAuthor": "Your Name",
  "wordsPerMinute": 200
}
```

## Blog Post Format

Create Markdown files in the `content/posts` folder with the following frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: "2025-01-01"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
author: "Author Name" # Optional, defaults to config.defaultAuthor
summary: "A brief summary of your post"
---

Your post content in Markdown format...
```

## How It Works

This blog now uses a static site generation approach:

1. All content is written in Markdown with frontmatter
2. The static generator processes Markdown content and generates HTML files
3. Pagination is pre-rendered based on the `postsPerPage` setting in the config
4. A minimal amount of JavaScript is included for:
   - Dark mode toggle
   - Optional interactive elements
5. All pages are generated as static HTML, resulting in:
   - Faster page loads
   - Better SEO
   - Improved security
   - Lower hosting costs

## Automated Deployment

The blog includes GitHub Actions configuration for automatic deployment:

1. Commit and push your changes to the main branch
2. GitHub Actions will build the static site
3. The built site will be deployed to GitHub Pages

You can customize the deployment in the `.github/workflows/build-deploy.yml` file.

## Customization

For advanced customization beyond the configuration file, you can:

1. Edit the CSS in `css/style.css`
2. Modify the static site generator in `scripts/static-site-generator.js`
3. Update the JavaScript in the `js` folder
